; 
; This file contains basic configuration parameters used to control
; Helioviewer.org's behavior. Before Helioviewer.org can be used, this file
; must be copied or renamed to Config.ini and adjusted to reflect your system
; settings. Many of the parameters are described below. For a more detailed
; description of the entire installation process, see the installation
; documentation located on the Helioviewer Wiki:

build_num   = 623

[viewer]
; Number of seconds the observation time will advance forward or move backward
; when the user steps through time.
default_timestep = 86400

; The amount of pixels outside the visible viewport which should be pre-fetched
; in order to speed up rendering. For example, to have Helioviewer.org download
; all tiles which are currently visible plus tiles which are just outside of the
; viewport, prefetch_size could be set to 512.
prefetch_size    = 0

[image_zoom_range]
; The default spatial scale, in arc-seconds per pixel, at 1 AU, for which images
; should be displayed. For optimal performance, it is best to pick a scale which
; is either equal to or a factor of two of the natural scale or one of your data
; sources. The default scale used in Helioviewer is based off AIA images:
;    default scale = aia_scale * 2^3 * (dsun_aia/1 au) 
;                  = 0.6 * 8 * (150872000000/149597870700)
; This will result in the default zoom level being an AIA image at 1/8 scale.
default_image_scale = 4.8408817

; The minimum spatial scale (arc-seconds/pixel) for which an image should be
; displayed. This limits how much a user can zoom in to an image. The value
; chosen should be a factor of two of the default_image_scale, i.e.
; min_image_scale = default_image_scale * (2^n) for some integer value of n.
min_image_scale     = 0.60511022

; The maximum spatial scale (arc-seconds/pixel) for which an image should be
; displayed. This limits how much a user can zoom out for an image. The value
; chosen should be a factor of two of the default_image_scale, i.e.
; min_image_scale = default_image_scale * (2^n) for some integer value of n.
max_image_scale     = 154.90822

; The maximum number of tile layers which may be displayed simultaneously.
max_tile_layers     = 5

[filepaths]
; The root directory where of your Helioviewer.org installation. This must be
; somewhere that Apache allows access to.

[environmental_variables]
; Any environmental variables to be set before executing command-line calls to
; Kakadu or ImageMagick. For example, on some systems it may be necessary to
; set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to point to the location of the Kakadu
; shared library.

[server]
; Back-end server for Helioviewer.org. Most often the front-end and back-end
; will be run together on the same server in which case the back-end is
; simply api/index.php. If another URL is specified, all queries will be
; sent to that server instead and JSONP will be used for any AJAX requests.

[image_params]
; The amount of bits per pixel which the resulting image should be stored at.
; Unless you know what you are doing and have a good reason (e.g. data that is
; at a higher quality) then you should probably leave this value alone.
bit_depth                = 8

; Note that this option does not work well with older versions of ImageMagick
; (versions < 6.5.1), and has been temporarily disabled until a safer solution
; has been found which will work with all versions.
num_colors               = 256

; The smallest width/height an event-based image can be, in pixels. This is used
; to ensure that events with very small bounding boxes get padded to these dimensions.
min_event_image_size     = 400

[jhelioviewer]
; The maximum frames allowed for a JPX image request. Requests which would go
; over this limit are automatically adjusted (sub-sampled) and a JPX file with
; this many or fewer frames is generated instead.
; Note that due to limitations relating to the length allowed for kdu_merge
; command-line arguments, values which are very large may not always work.
; Future versions of Helioviewer may include a work-around to this limitation,
; however, the limit currently allowed should probably be sufficient for most
; cases.

; No all video codecs have support for multi-threaded encoding, but two of
; the libraries used by Helioviewer.org (libx264 and libvpx) do support 
; parallelization. Note that while setting this value to '0' will cause
; libx264 to use all available CPU's, this does not work for libvpx and
; should therefor be avoided.
ffmpeg_max_threads = 4

; The default framerate to use for generated movies

[statistics]

; version (helioviewer.min.js) of all the custom JavaScript code instead
; including one file for each class, which will decrease loading time.
