Helioviewer.org 2.0.0
======================
 
Helioviewer.org 2.0.0 is a major rewrite of the original version of 
Helioviewer.org including a large number of changes to both the server-side and
front-end componenets. The main difference between this version and earlier 
version of Helioviewer are the JPEG 2000 (JP2) tiling engine. While previous 
versions had very strict requirements regarding the properties of the images to
be processed (which required many images to be rescaled and padded and also
include additional derrived header information), this release is able to accept
a much wider range of images for input.

In addition to the modifications to the tiling engine, other major changes
include:

 * Modular server-side capable of running only the desired set of components.
 * Front-end rewritten entirely in jQuery.
 * Improved support for Internet Explorer (IE), Safari, Chrome, and Opera
   web browsers.
 * Better JHelioviewer integration.
 * New layout.
 * Database performance boost.
 * Easier setup and configuration including a graphical installer.
 * Easier sharing.
 * More secure.
 
This release also includes a number of bug fixes to the earlier version
including a long-standing tiling bug which would occasionally result in missing
tiles.
